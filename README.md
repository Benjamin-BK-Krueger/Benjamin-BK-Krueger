### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Ben Krueger!

I'm a Cyber Security Fanatic & Generic IT Fairy. I love doing riddles and solving problems. I have specialized in the area of cyber security but I'm far away from being an expert. I guess my average day is missing 8 additional hours, I do have a lovely family which is always number one! What's left of the day I'm using that to discover new things, trying out software or even playing CTF like stuff.

I have built up quite a huge library containing code snippets, notes, hints, walkthroughs, etc. For future documentation I will use this shiny GitHub space so other people can use that information as well during their research/projects.
