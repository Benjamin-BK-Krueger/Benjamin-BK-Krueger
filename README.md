### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Ben Krueger!

I'm a Cyber Security Fanatic & Generic IT Fairy. I love doing riddles and solving problems. I have specialized in the area of cyber security but I'm far away from being an expert. I guess my average day is missing 8 additional hours, I do have a lovely family which is always number one! What's left of the day I use to discover new things, try out software or even play CTF like stuff.

Feel free to visit my wordpress site [www.blk8.de](http://www.blk8.de), there may be some interesting posts there as well for you.
